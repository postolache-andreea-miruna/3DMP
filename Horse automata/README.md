# Horse Automata,Prototype

#### The author of this mechanism is Greg Zumwalt.  He posted the mechanism on the [site](https://www.instructables.com/Horse-Prototype/)

#### I used Fusion 360 to design and render the mechanism.

## Why this mechanism?
#### I chose this mechanism because I like horses and also because it involves a lot of attention and it is very cute.

## Description and how it works

The project that I chose is Horse Automata which shows the way a horse can move.

To work, this mechanism uses a 6vdc 300rpm gear motor (33x12mm 300RPM Metal Mini DC 6V Gearbox Gearwheel Motor Mini Reduce Speed Geared Electric Motor), a 6vdc wall mount power supply, and a phono jack for the power supply to power Horse, Prototype.

When it is started, the wheels are moved by the gear worm and in this way the horse moves.

## Main components and joints
### I chose to divide the mechanism into the following components :

- ### Head
	
 #### To make the head I made a canvas based on the stl from the main mechanism.

 #### I created the sketch based on the canvas and I extruded it.

 #### The head is located in front on a spacer body and it moves together with the support of the front legs.

- ### Tail
 #### To make the tail I made a canvas based on the stl from the main mechanism.

 #### I created the sketch based on the canvas and I extruded it.

 #### The tail is located in the back on a spacer body and it moves together with the support of the rear legs.

- ### Screw first tipe
 #### I imported the screw from McMaster and copied it to put it in several places.

- ### Screw second type
 #### I imported the screw from McMaster and changed the size and appearance of the end of the screw with a transversal plane.

 #### I also copied it to put it in more places.

- ### Spacer body
 #### I made a sketch for each spacer and extruded it.

- ### Body:
		        
			- body front
		        
			- body behind
		        
			- cam front
		        
			- cam froont behind
		        
			- cam rear face
		       
		        - cam rear behind
		        
			- gear idler- circle-shaped middle 
		        
			- gear idler- circle-shaped middle L 
		        
			- gear idler- hexagon-shaped middle
		        
			- gear idler- hexagon-shaped middle L
		        
			- gear worm
		        
 
 
 #### To make the body front I made measurements on the component from the initial mechanism and I created the sketch, after which I extruded it. Before extruding it, I made a copy of the component to have the body behind it.
  #### To make the front cams, I made three sketches as follows: one of the hexagon type that I extruded, one circular on the surface of the hexagon and the third one is the outer circle. Cam front differs from cam rear by the size of the outer circle.
  #### To make the wheels I measured the component from the initial mechanism and I made a canvas based on it. I made the sketch and copied the component several times and then I extruded them, and for the wheels with hexagon form in the middle I made an additional sketch.
  #### To make the gear worm I made the measurements on the initial component and I made the sketch that I extruded. To make the spiral I made two planes to delimit the area where the spiral will be.

- front legs:
		         
			 - support upper leg front left
      		         
			 - support upper leg front right
		         
			 - hoof front
		         
			 - leg front lower rear
		         
			 - leg front upper rear
		         
			 - leg front upper front
		         
			 - leg front lower front

- rear legs:
		         
			 - support upper leg rear left
		         
			 - support upper leg rear right
		         
			 - leg rear lower front
		         
			 - leg rear upper front
		         
			 - leg rear upper rear left
		         
			 - leg rear lower rear
		         
			 - leg rear upper rear right
		         
			 - hoof rear

- holder
		         
			 - base
		         
			 - housing motor

Checkpoint 2
I made the motor house and the base (bonus) and also I made the body front and the body back.

14.05.2021(checkpoint 3)

I made the: 
		-spacer body ( spacer central right, spacer central left, spacer for head and spacer for tail)
		-gear worm 
		-gear idler circled shaped in the middle
		-gear idler with a hexagon shape in the middle
		-cam front (behind and front for the front legs)
		-cam rear (behind and front for the rearlegs)
		-tail
		-head
I import the screws but after that I design them.
For gears, tail and head I import a photo with them with the measure.
Also, I transform the motor up part of the motor into a component.
I made some joints for the tail, head and gears.
