# Horse Automata,Prototype

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtO8aX2QzzY

The project that I chose is Horse Automata which shows the way a horse can move. 
To work, this mechanism uses a motor.
When it is started, the wheels are moved by the gear worm and in this way the horse moves.


I chose to divide the mechanism into the following components :

		- head

		- tail

		- screw first tipe

		- screw second type

		- spacer body

		- body:
		        - body front
		        - body back
		        - cam front
		        - cam rear
		        - gear idler- circle-shaped middle 
		        - gear idler- hexagon-shaped middle
		        - gear worm

		- front legs:
		         - support upper leg front left
      		         - support upper leg front right
		         - hoof front
		         - leg front lower rear
		         - leg front upper rear
		         - leg front upper front
		         - leg front lower front

		- rear legs:
		         - support upper leg rear left
		         - support upper leg rear right
		         - leg rear lower front
		         - leg rear upper front
		         - leg rear upper rear left
		         - leg rear lower rear
		         - leg rear upper rear right
		         - hoof rear

		- holder
		         - base
		         - housing motor

Checkpoint 2
I made the motor house and the base (bonus) and also I made the body front and the body back.

14.05.2021(checkpoint 3)

I made the: 
		-spacer body ( spacer central right, spacer central left, spacer for head and spacer for tail)
		-gear worm 
		-gear idler circled shaped in the middle
		-gear idler with a hexagon shape in the middle
		-cam front (behind and front for the front legs)
		-cam rear (behind and front for the rearlegs)
		-tail
		-head
I import the screws but after that I design them.
For gears, tail and head I import a photo with them with the measure.
Also, I transform the motor up part of the motor into a component.
I made some joints for the tail, head and gears.
