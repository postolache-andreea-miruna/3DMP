	The project that I chose is Horse Automata which shows the way a horse can move. 
	To work, this mechanism uses a motor.
	When it is started, the wheels are moved by the gear worm and in this way the horse moves.


	I chose to divide the mechanism into the following components :

		- head

		- tail

		- screw first tipe

		- screw second type

		- spacer body

		- body:
		        - body front
		        - body back
		        - cam front
		        - cam rear
		        - gear idler- circle-shaped middle 
		        - gear idler- hexagon-shaped middle
		        - gear worm

		- front legs:
		         - support upper leg front left
      		         - support upper leg front right
		         - hoof front
		         - leg front lower rear
		         - leg front upper rear
		         - leg front upper front
		         - leg front lower front

		- rear legs:
		         - support upper leg rear left
		         - support upper leg rear right
		         - leg rear lower front
		         - leg rear upper front
		         - leg rear upper rear left
		         - leg rear lower rear
		         - leg rear upper rear right
		         - hoof rear

		- holder
		         - base
		         - housing motor

	I made the motor house and the base (bonus) and also I made the body front and the body back.
