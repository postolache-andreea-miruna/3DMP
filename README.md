3DMP -  Homework no. 1
Tasks:
Install Fusion 360 on your laptop
Create an Autodesk student account and log yourself in using Fusion 360 on your laptop
Install Prusa Slicer on your laptop
Create a 3D pixel art style keychain. By starting from a 2D sketch you need to fit those specific dimensions: 10 cm (X) x 7 cm (Y) x 1 cm (Z)
Slice the model in Prusa Slicer

3DMP -  Homework 2
Tasks:
Download a model from Thingiverse and modify it. Think of an useful improvement. If you’re happy with the new design, upload it as a remix of the original.
Design model A1(following the lab video tutorials), A2, A3, A4(following the lab video tutorials) you can find the isometric schemes at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16N1ziNJJ3GGEMqk-bpYgEOiDIbeWBGdc?usp=sharing

3DMP -  Homework no. 3
Tasks:
Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on).
Import an SVG (link here) and design a chess pieces set: 
1 pawn, 
1 knight, 
1 bishop, 
1 rook, 
1 queen,
1 king.
Use the SVG sketch to revolve the pieces: 
you need to take care when designing the knight; only the base should be revolved; find another solution for the horse part e.g: extrusion, fillet, etc.
when designing the bishop, revolve the part that doesn’t have the slit, and add the slit after.

When using revolve, you need two things: the profile and the axis:
For the profile, you will use half of the chess piece (Fig. 3.1 dark blue part)
For the axis, you will use a line (Fig. 3.1 the red line) that cuts the piece in half. 
You need to add this line by yourself, editing the SVG sketch using constraints (don’t add it using a new sketch, it needs to be in the same sketch for the revolve to work).
Use a circular pattern to add details on the top, neck and base of the pieces.
The SVG is a little bit stylized. The chess pieces contain smaller parts that are not connected. For the full grade, you need to find a way to make each chess piece only one body! (Fig. 3.2)

Slice all the pieces in PrusaSlicer. 
BONUS: Make the board as well. Multiply the pieces and align them on the board. Add appearance (videos about appearance can be found in the course).
