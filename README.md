3DMP -  Homework no. 1
Tasks:
Install Fusion 360 on your laptop
Create an Autodesk student account and log yourself in using Fusion 360 on your laptop
Install Prusa Slicer on your laptop
Create a 3D pixel art style keychain. By starting from a 2D sketch you need to fit those specific dimensions: 10 cm (X) x 7 cm (Y) x 1 cm (Z)
Slice the model in Prusa Slicer
Push the homework on GitHub

3DMP -  Homework 2
Tasks:
Download a model from Thingiverse and modify it. Think of an useful improvement. If you’re happy with the new design, upload it as a remix of the original.
Design model A1(following the lab video tutorials), A2, A3, A4(following the lab video tutorials) you can find the isometric schemes at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16N1ziNJJ3GGEMqk-bpYgEOiDIbeWBGdc?usp=sharing

3DMP -  Homework no. 3
Tasks:
Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on).
Import an SVG (link here) and design a chess pieces set: 
1 pawn, 
1 knight, 
1 bishop, 
1 rook, 
1 queen,
1 king.
Use the SVG sketch to revolve the pieces: 
you need to take care when designing the knight; only the base should be revolved; find another solution for the horse part e.g: extrusion, fillet, etc.
when designing the bishop, revolve the part that doesn’t have the slit, and add the slit after.

When using revolve, you need two things: the profile and the axis:
For the profile, you will use half of the chess piece (Fig. 3.1 dark blue part)
For the axis, you will use a line (Fig. 3.1 the red line) that cuts the piece in half. 
You need to add this line by yourself, editing the SVG sketch using constraints (don’t add it using a new sketch, it needs to be in the same sketch for the revolve to work).
Use a circular pattern to add details on the top, neck and base of the pieces.
The SVG is a little bit stylized. The chess pieces contain smaller parts that are not connected. For the full grade, you need to find a way to make each chess piece only one body! (Fig. 3.2)

Slice all the pieces in PrusaSlicer. 
BONUS: Make the board as well. Multiply the pieces and align them on the board. Add appearance (videos about appearance can be found in the course).


3DMP -  Homework no. 4

Watch and understand the courses videos about Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (Bonus: we recommend to model them on your own as well)
Design the Scotch Yoke Mechanism taking the course videos as reference (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
Choose ONE mechanism from the next list and design it in Fusion:

Requirements for 2 and 3:
	Divide the mechanism into components
	Use Fusion Rule Number 1
	Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed (Create a stand for the mechanism - like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos - so they will not levitate)
	Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints, contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your project
	Add appearances
	Add joints
	Create a motion study
	Render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well)
OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on). You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body and component.
